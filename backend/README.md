# TASK List in Python

## Setup
Once you ensured that [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) are available on your system, run

> pip install -r requirements.pip

Once all packages are installed, you can start the server from the root folder by running

> python ./main.py

The server can then be accessed at http://localhost:5000. Note however that the database must be running in order for the server to function correctly.
